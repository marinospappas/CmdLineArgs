# CmdLineArgs

A suggestion how to process command line arguments

It is based on the techniques demonstrated by [Jack Crenshaw](https://jackcrenshaw.com/) 
in his tutorial series ["Let's Build a Compiler!"](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/), 
which were also followed in my adaptation of the series: 
[marinospappas/LetsBuildACompiler](https://github.com/marinospappas/Lets-Build-a-Compiler)
